              <p>Are you looking for a way to put a little bit of time into an otherwise slightly gray everyday
                evening? Then take your smartest friends under your arm and visit the Flintstone Pub. Here you do
                not have to wait for the weekend to get a cozy and fun evening in the city. On the first and last
                Tuesday of each month, Flintstone Pub opens its doors to the pub quiz. Here is the guarantee of
                sharp competition, good atmosphere and high mood behind the bar. We dare to call our quiz evening
                the best and most fun in Aarhus, and even though it is fun enough just to be there, there is of
                course a fantastic prize for the winners. </p>

              <p><strong> So there is a stove in the oven for a good evening if you are part of the quiz with us.</strong>
                Here you
                will be tested in the knowledge of everything from the king's kingdom to sports and geography.
                However, you should not be scared if you are not the big bezzerwisser, as there is of course also
                plenty of opportunity to just enjoy the good atmosphere and a cold draft beer in our cozy rooms.
                It's free to join, and as something special, students get a discount on beer. So there is no
                excuse not to forget the homework a little and spend a Tuesday night with the fellow students at
                Flintstone Pub in the heart of Aarhus..</p>
